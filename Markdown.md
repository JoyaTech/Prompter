# "Flow-It Magical": Strategic Plan & Feature Roadmap

## 1. Project Analysis & Health Check

This analysis provides a high-level overview of the current state of the joyatech/prompter codebase.

### What's Working Well

*   **Solid Foundation**: The project is built on a modern and robust stack (React, TypeScript, Vite), which is excellent for scalability and maintainability.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The use of distinct components for different UI sections (Sidebar, Header, PromptEditor, etc.) promotes code reuse and separation of concerns.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**: The setup with i18next is a professional approach that makes the application accessible to a global audience from the start.
*   **Separation of Concerns (Services)**: The introduction of `dataService.ts` and `geminiService.ts` is a significant architectural advantage. It decouples the UI from the business logic and data persistence, making the code cleaner and easier to test.
*   **Type Safety**: The comprehensive use of TypeScript in `types.ts` ensures that the data structures are well-defined and consistent throughout the application, reducing runtime errors.

### Opportunities for Refinement

*   **State Management**: As the application grows, passing state and handler functions through multiple layers of props (`App.tsx` -> `PromptEditor.tsx` -> `OutputDisplay.tsx`) will become cumbersome.
    *   **Recommendation**: Introduce a more robust state management solution. For a project of this size, React's built-in Context API would be a perfect fit. We can create a dedicated `AlchemistProvider` to manage the state for the new feature, avoiding prop drilling.
*   **API Service Layer**: The `geminiService.ts` file currently handles direct API calls.
    *   **Recommendation**: Abstract this further. Create a generic API service that can handle different endpoints and data sources. This will be crucial when we start fetching data from the GitHub repository.

## 2. The Future Roadmap: New Ideas & Enhancements

With the core "Alchemist" and "A/B Testing" features in place, here are some ideas for future sprints to establish a strong product moat.

### Gamification & Community

*   **Prompt Mastery Score**: Award points to users for creating prompts, receiving positive feedback (rating in `HistoryItem`), and having their prompts saved by others.
*   **Leaderboards**: Display top "Prompt Alchemists" on the dashboard.
*   **Community Library**: Allow users to submit their best "brewed" prompts to a community-visible section of the Alchemist's Library, complete with upvotes and comments.

### Advanced Alchemist Features

*   **Essence Extraction 2.0**: Instead of just using the whole prompt as an "essence," use a Gemini function call to analyze a prompt and extract key modifiers (e.g., tone, format, persona).
*   **"Surprise Me" Button**: A feature that randomly selects a base prompt and 2-3 essences from the library and brews them together for creative inspiration.
*   **A/B Testing Workbench**: An advanced version of the workbench where a user can brew two different combinations of essences with the same base prompt and see the generated outputs side-by-side.

### Deeper IDE Integration

*   **Version Control for Prompts**: Allow users to see a history of their saved prompts, diff between versions, and revert changes.
*   **Prompt Folders/Tagging**: As users save more prompts, they will need better ways to organize them than a single flat list.
*   **Export/Import**: Allow users to export their saved prompts and history as a JSON file, and import them into other instances of the application.
